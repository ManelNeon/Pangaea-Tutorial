# Pangaea Tutorial
 First Project Using Unreal Engine 5 with both C++ and Blueprints

 Using the book : "Unreal Engine 5 Game Development with C++ Scripting: Become a professional game developer and create fully functional, high-quality games". I got a grasp of how to program C++ in Unreal Engine 5. Unfortunatly, this book had way too many coding errors and bad practises in my opinion. So I decided to abandon this project, and start working in the one that was actually meant for class.

 All in all, it still was a great learning experience, as without it I would have had a much greater difficulty applying my C++ knowledge in Unreal Engine.
